<p><strong>Beach Chair Position And Anesthesia</strong>, We hypothesize that the incidence of CDEs with general anesthesia in beach chair position would be first in the range of 2080 as previously determined and second that CDEs would correlate with cerebral blood flow impairment and neurobehavioral decline. After positioning hypo-tension was induced and maintained at a target mean arterial pressure MAP of 60 to 65 mm Hg with continuous infusion of remifentanil. It is helpful to place the trunk almost upright with an almost hanging arm to help reduce the fracture by ligamentotaxis and gravity. A prospective study on the effect of general anesthesia compared with regional anesthesia and sedation.</p>

<p>According to a report by Murphy et al3 shoulder surgery in the beach chair position was associated with a significant reduction in cerebral oxygenation. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of intravenous general anesthesia and controlled hypotension on cerebral saturation rScO 2 cerebral blood flow measured as middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity Vmax MCA and neurobehavioral outcome in patients scheduled for shoulder surgery in beach chair position. 2 This series has prompted investigators to study how intraoperative management factors blood pressure type of anesthesia. Hence while doing shoulder surgery in an upright position if a blood pressure reading for a cuff placed at the level of the heart is 12080 mmHg and there is 25 cm of elevation between it and the external auditory meatus the cerebral pressure is 10262.</p>

<p>That the use of the beach chair position under general anesthesia did not alter cerebral oxygenation several studies have reported a causal relationship between the beach chair position and cerebral hypoperfusion34. However TOI values did not change with induction of general anesthesia or placement of the patients in the beach chair position. Anesthetic agents have distinct effects on cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism 1415 which may have implications for beach chair positioning. The authors state that although both the beach chair position and the addition of positive end-expiratory pressure each.

<p>Approximately two-thirds of the 400000 shoulder surgery procedures performed annually in the United States are performed with the patients head elevated above the horizontal a position know as the beach chair position BCP. Throughout the 2 hour and 20-minute operation his blood pressure was measured noninvasively by a cuff placed on his left arm varying from 13050 to 9055 mmHg. Anesthesia and found significant reduc-tions in cerebral oxygenation in patients in the beach-chair position as opposed to the lateral decubitus position. The advantages of the beach chair position include the ease of setup limited brachial plexus stress increased glenohumeral and subacromial visualization anesthesia flexibility and the ability to easily convert to an open procedure.

<p>1 In 2005 Pohl and Cullen published a 4-patient case series describing catastrophic cerebral ischemia in patients undergoing shoulder surgery in the BCP. At our insti-tution we performed a small study with institutional review board approval com-paring mechanical ventilation to sponta-neous ventilation both general anesthesia. The anesthesiologist provided the anesthesia while patient was on the bed then the patient was moved to the beach chair position - I dont think this is considered major position change. In ASA I-II patients intravenous general anesthesia and controlled hypotension in the beach chair position affects cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygenation with impact on the neurobehavioral outcome.
