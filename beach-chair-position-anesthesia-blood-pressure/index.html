The conversion from the cm of elevation difference between the two sites and the mm of Hg of pressure is not linear. The beach chair position BCP during shoulder arthroscopy is a known risk factor for cerebral ischemia. Hence while doing shoulder surgery in an upright position if a blood pressure reading for a cuff placed at the level of the heart is 12080 mmHg and there is 25 cm of elevation between it and the external auditory meatus the cerebral pressure is 10262.
